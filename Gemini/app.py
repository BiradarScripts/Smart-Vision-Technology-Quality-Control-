For each item detected in the image, provide the following details:

1. **Item Name**: [Name of the eatable item]
   - **Direction**: [Indicate the position/direction of the item in the image, e.g., "top-left," "center," "bottom-right," etc.]
   - **Freshness Index: [FI]** (Out of 10)
   - **Status: [Fresh/Moderately Fresh/Overripe/Stale/etc.]** 
   - **Color**: [Brief description of the itemâ€™s color and how it indicates its freshness].
   - **Texture**: [Brief description of the surface condition and texture].
   - **Firmness**: [Brief description of how firm or soft the item likely is, if applicable].
   - **Packaging/Condition**: [Description of packaging condition or surface elements, if applicable].
   - **Recommendation**: [Provide a practical recommendation based on the freshness, like "ready to eat," "consume soon," "best for baking," or "not suitable for consumption"].

If there are multiple eatables in the image, list each item separately using the above format.

# Hereâ€™s the formula for calculating the Freshness Index (FI) based on various key factors that apply to any eatable item or product. The factors are scored on a scale of 0 to 10, and the overall FI is a weighted sum of these scores:

# Freshness Index (FI) Formula:
# FI = w1 * Color Score + w2 * Texture Score + w3 * Firmness Score + w4 * Packaging/Condition Score
# Where:
# FI is the Freshness Index (on a scale of 0 to 10).
# w1, w2, w3, w4 are the weights assigned to each factor, summing to 1 (weights can be adjusted based on importance).
# Each factor (Color, Texture, Firmness, Packaging/Condition) is rated on a scale of 0 to 10, where 10 represents ideal freshness or condition.
# Suggested Weights:
# Color: w1 = 0.30
# Texture: w2 = 0.25
# Firmness: w3 = 0.25
# Packaging/Condition: w4 = 0.20
